Parent→child *within* a block (asymmetric containment); co-extensive pairs are reported as duplicates (renames/splits), never edges.

## Block B0  (128 features)
- **417** directed edges, **3** duplicate pairs, 302 survive PMI>0; PolyFrac 99%, Gini 0.951.
- In-block superparents: 2 (e.g. F44 _technical terminology related to programming …_: 125 children, fires 99%).
