"""The paper captions cannot be checked for truth, so their INPUTS are pinned.

`test_captions_match_panels.py` guards the dashboards in `reporting/visualize.py`
against the panel moving under a caption that still describes the old one. This is
the other half of the same problem, for `reporting/make_report_figures.py`, and it
guards the opposite direction: the panel stays exactly where it was and the DATA
underneath it changes.

That is not hypothetical. Switching the reference toy checkpoint left two captions
asserting a world that had stopped existing:

    "every miss is an edge whose child the SAE never learned"   -- nothing missed
    "The SAE conflated two concepts the grammar keeps apart"    -- it conflated none

Both figures drew the same two panels before and after, so a panel fingerprint would
have passed. Every number in those sentences was computed and updated itself; the
sentences around them were hand-written English and did not.

What this test does is narrow, and worth stating plainly: **it does not check that any
caption is correct.** It cannot. It fails when the data a caption is written against is
regenerated, which sends whoever regenerated it back to the caption. A tripwire, not a
proof -- the same bargain the dashboard test makes.

Only inputs whose captions carry hand-written claims are pinned. Adding a file here
costs nothing; leaving one out costs a caption that quietly goes stale.
